##### Problem statement ######
Given training cab service data set to predict fare amount
#####

####
---->>>Created prediction model to predict fare amount
####

### Apporach to create the model
1) find feature variables from training data set
2) derived new feature variable from existing variable
3) clean the data
4) Deal with null values from feature variable (based on charateristic of the variable)
5) Created different regression model.
	1) for each model find best fit parameters
5) find best model among all
6) apply the selected model on test data and predict the fare amount

###Created Regression model list
1) Linear model regression
2) Ploynomial regression
3) Lasso
4) Xgboost regression
5) Gradient regression
6) Nureal net regression
7) ExtraTrees regression
